/*

background-repeat: no-repeat;
By default, background images repeat to fill the entire background area. 
Setting no-repeat prevents the image from repeating, displaying it only once.


background-attachment: fixed;
This property controls how the background image behaves when you scroll the page.
Setting it to fixed keeps the image fixed in place, 
so it doesnâ€™t move as you scroll, creating a "parallax" effect.
Without fixed, the image would move along with the page as you scroll.

background-position: center;
This positions the background image at the center of the screen, 
both horizontally and vertically.
Without this, the default position is the top-left corner of the screen.

background-size: cover;
The cover value scales the image so that it fully covers the background area.
The image will be resized to cover the entire viewport,
maintaining its aspect ratio. If the viewport's aspect ratio differs from the image's, 
some parts of the image might be cropped to ensure there are no empty spaces.
